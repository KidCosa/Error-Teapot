    - Create a platform for artists to advertise and get paid for their work.
4. The essential features of the application:
    - As a user, I want to login to my portfolio.
    - As a user, I want to enter a brief bio.
    - As a user, I want to manage the content in my porfolio.
    - As a user, I want to set the asking price of my work.
    - As a user, I want a buyer to be able to contact me.
